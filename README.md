While the effectiveness of Capomulin seems to be comparable to Ramicane, it is significantly more effective than Infubinol and Ceftamine (based on the box plots of the final tumor volumes)

The heavier the mouse, the less effective the drug is (see scatter plot). 

The results of the study are very consistent, thus reliable, as there is only 1 outlier in the data set for the top drugs, and none for Capomulin 

Of the 4 drug regimens we analyized, Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective at decreasing tumor size. The least effective were the other two drugs Infubinol and Ceftamin. Therefore, I would recommend we do further studies or advance the two effective drugs to the next stage of trials.
